The plot tells of a story of revenge through the eyes of an innocent man named <u><b><i>Edmond Dantes</u></b></i>, an innocent man who was unjustly accused by his own jealous friends and was thrown in an unforgiving prison called <u><b><i>Chateau d'If</u></b></i>.

After escaping the prison, Edmond constructs an ingenious plan of revenge against those who wronged him. The moral of the story is that "Revenge does more damage to the avenger than to the avenged."

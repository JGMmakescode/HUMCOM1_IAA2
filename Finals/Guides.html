        <h3>WHAT IS VR (VIRTUAL REALITY)</h3> 
    <p class="p1">
    It is a term used to describe a 3-dimensional, computer generated environment which can be 
    explored and interacted with by a person. The user becomes part of the generated virtual world 
    where he/she is immersed with the environment while interacting with the objects. It makes the user
    believe they're world where they can use their imagination.

        <h3>THE BASICS</h3> 
    <p class="p1">
     The most important equipment is the headset. It is a device like a thick pair of goggles that 
     you wear it for head and eyes. It also comes with hand controllers to feel and touch the virtual 
     world. The hand controllers come with straps so that it would not fall on the floor. When you buy
     our VR devices from our store it is affordable and has higher quality. When you purchase our devices
     they have their own app stores where you can browse and download any apps and games as well.

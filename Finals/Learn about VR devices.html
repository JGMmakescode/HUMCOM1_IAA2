        <h3>OCULUS RIFT</h3> 
    <p class="p1">
    It is a virtual reality headset (VR headset) that is designed to connect to a high-powered PC to 
    enable advanced computations and graphics rendering. The original prototype of Oculus Rift was created in 2011 by the (then) 18-year-old Palmer Luckey in his parent's 
    garage in Long Beach, California. John Carmack, founder of the pioneering 3D gaming company iD Software, took the prototype to the E3 videogame show. A year later, an HD (high-definition) version of the device reignited consumer interest in virtual reality.

        <h3>HTC VR</h3>
        <p class="p1">
            The HTC Vive is a fully immersive virtual reality headset. The HTC Vive headset and controllers
            cost around $600 - $800. It works by using two sensors in each corner of the room, the HTC Vive tracks and maps your movement
            around the room. The headset is connected to the computer via a long cord, and the
            controllers are wireless. A computer that has the processing power to run virtual reality is also
            required, which can get pretty expensive. The Vive is powered by SteamVR, which is a virtual
            reality based gaming software.
